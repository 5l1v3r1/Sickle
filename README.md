# Sickle

Sickle is a shellcode development tool created to speed up the various steps in creating a functioning payload. Although modules are aimed towards assembler, sickle is geared towards crafting payloads in various languages and is not limited to shellcode.

Sickle can aid in the following:
- Identifying instructions resulting in bad characters when crafting shellcode
- Formatting output in various languages (python, perl, javascript, etc).
- Accepting bytecode via STDIN and formatting it.
- Executing shellcode in both Windows and Linux environments.
- Comparing a bytecode sample to a modified binary.
- Dissembling shellcode into assembly language (ARM, x86, etc).
- Shellcode extraction via objdump (although binfiles never fail!)

### Quick failure check
A task I found myself doing repetitively was compiling assembler source code then extracting the shellcode, placing it into a wrapper, and testing it. If it was a bad run, the process would be repeated until successful. Sickle takes care of placing the shellcode into a wrapper for quick testing. (Works on Windows and Unix systems):

### Recreating shellcode
Sometimes you find a piece of shellcode that's fluent in its execution and you want to recreate it yourself to understand its underlying mechanisms. Sickle can help you compare the original shellcode to your "recreated" version. If you're not crafting shellcode and just need 2 binfiles to be the same this feature can also help verifying files are the same byte by byte.

### Disassembly
Sickle can also take a binary file and convert the extracted opcodes (shellcode) to machine instructions. Keep in mind this works with raw opcodes (-r), object files (-obj), and STDIN (-s) as well. In the following example I am converting a reverse shell designed by Stephen Fewer to assembly.

### Bad character identification
It's important to note that currently bad character identification is best used within a Linux based operating system. When dumping shellcode on a Windows host bad characters will NOT be highlighted.

### Module Based Design

This tool was originally designed as a one big script, however recently when a change needed to be done to the script I had to relearn my own code... In order to avoid this in the future I've decided to keep all modules under the "modules" directory. If you prefer the old design, I have kept a copy under the DOCUMENTATION directory.

```sh

### Windows Installation
If you decide to opt-out of the disassembly functions and only want to use Sickle as a wrapper/dumping tool Sickle will work out of the box with any Python version (Including 2.7). I have only encountered issues when writing/testing 64 bit shellcode on a Windows 10 host. In order to avoid problems I recommend installing [Python 3.4.4  (amd64)](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.4/python-3.4.4.amd64.msi) however any other Windows version should not have this issue. Should you be writing x86 shellcode, Windows 10 will work with any Python version e.g. [Python 3.7.0a3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0a3.exe).

### Linux Installation
Sickle is written in Python3 and to have full functionality I recommend installing [capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) directly. If you don't need the disassembly function Sickle should work out of the box. Installation of Capstone is as easy as 1,2,3:
- apt-get install python3-pip
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- python3 setup.py install
    
If you don't compile your shellcode in NASM I have added an "[objdump2shellcode](https://github.com/wetw0rk/objdump2shellcode)" like function. Although I recommend using NASM for a streamline experience.

```sh
root@kali:~# sickle -h
usage: sickle.py [-h] [-r READ] [-f FORMAT] [-s] [-e EXAMINE] [-obj OBJDUMP]
                 [-m MODULE] [-a ARCH] [-b BADCHARS] [-v VARNAME] [-l]
